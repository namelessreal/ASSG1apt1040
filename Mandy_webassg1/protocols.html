            <h2>Section 1:HTTP vs HTTPS</h2>
            <p><p><strong>HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)</strong> is a protocol used to transfer data over the web. However, it does not encrypt the data being transmitted, which makes it vulnerable to interception.</p>
        <p><strong>HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure)</strong> is the secure version of HTTP. It uses SSL/TLS to encrypt the connection, ensuring that data transferred between the user and the website is secure and protected from eavesdropping or tampering.</p>
        <p><strong>Importance:</strong> HTTPS is essential for protecting sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, and personal data. It also helps with website credibility and SEO ranking.</p> </p>

        <h2>Section 2: FTP vs. SFTP</h2>
        <p><strong>FTP (File Transfer Protocol)</strong> is used to transfer files between a client and server. However, it sends data in plain text, including credentials, which makes it insecure for modern usage.</p>
        <p><strong>SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol)</strong> is a secure version of FTP that operates over SSH. It encrypts both commands and data, providing a secure method for file transfer.</p>
        <p><strong>Use Cases:</strong> FTP may still be used in controlled environments or legacy systems, but SFTP is preferred for secure file transfers, especially in enterprise and cloud environments where security is a priority.</p>

        <p>
Communication protocols are important in system design for several reasons: 
<ul>
<li><strong>Interoperability:</strong> They define a common language and rules for different components to communicate effectively.</li>
<li><strong>Reliability:</strong></strong> They provide mechanisms for error detection, correction, and recovery, ensuring data transmission even in the presence of network issues.</li>
<li><strong>Performance:</strong> Proper protocols enhance communication efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Protocols allow systems to handle increasing loads.</li>
<li><strong>Security:</strong> They help protect data during transmission.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility and Extensibility:</strong> Protocols allow for future system enhancements</p>
        </ul>
